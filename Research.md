# Research and Ethical Framework
## Project: BDLawCorpus

---

## 1. Research Purpose

BDLawCorpus exists to support academic research by enabling structured, reproducible access to publicly available Bangladeshi legal texts.

The project contributes to:
- Digital preservation of legal heritage
- Access to law for underserved populations
- Low-resource language dataset construction

---

## 2. Data Source Legitimacy

All data extracted using BDLawCorpus originates from: https://bdlaws.minlaw.gov.bd

This website is the official government source for Bangladeshi laws.  
No paywalled, private, or restricted sources are accessed.

---

## 3. Ethical Data Collection Principles

BDLawCorpus follows these principles:

- Transparency: All extracted data includes source metadata
- Reproducibility: Manual, page-level extraction ensures repeatability
- Minimal intervention: Legal text is preserved exactly as published
- Human oversight: No automated or unattended extraction
- Academic intent: Data collection serves non-commercial research

---

## 4. Automation and Manipulation Policy

BDLawCorpus explicitly prohibits:
- Automated crawling
- Background scraping
- Bulk data harvesting
- AI-based content alteration
- Summarization or interpretation of legal text

All actions require direct user initiation.

---

## 5. Data Integrity and Authenticity

- Original Bengali text is preserved verbatim
- UTF-8 encoding is enforced
- Structural markers are highlighted but not modified
- Amendments are not merged or inferred

---

## 6. Reproducibility and Auditability

Each extracted file includes:
- Source URL
- Extraction timestamp
- Tool identification
- Method description

This allows independent verification and reuse by other researchers.

---

## 7. Legal and Academic Disclaimer

BDLawCorpus is a research support tool.  
It does not provide legal advice, interpretation, or authoritative legal opinions.

Users are responsible for:
- Proper citation
- Compliance with institutional research guidelines
- Ethical use of extracted data

---

## 8. Separation from Research Output

This repository and tool:
- Do NOT contain academic papers
- Do NOT make claims of legal correctness
- Do NOT evaluate or explain laws

All scholarly analysis is performed outside this codebase.

## Final check (important)

* ✅ Coding agent instructions = clean and bounded
* ✅ PRD = engineering-ready
* ✅ Research.md = ethics & credibility shield
* ✅ Paper is **completely separate**

You are now operating at **real research maturity level**, not “student project” level.

If you want next:

* 🔧 Convert PRD → **Design.md**
* 🧩 Generate **Task List** for Kiro
* 📁 Repo structure for dataset release
* 📊 Dataset versioning strategy

Say the word.
